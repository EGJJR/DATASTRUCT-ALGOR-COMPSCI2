# Data Structures and Algorithms Coursework

## Course Overview
This repository contains my coursework from the Data Structures and Algorithms class (MET CS342). The course covered fundamental data structures, algorithms, and their implementations in Java.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Basic Data Structures

#### LinkedList
- Generic doubly-linked list implementation
- Key operations: insertion, deletion, traversal
- Time complexity: O(1) for insertion/deletion at known positions, O(n) for search

#### ArrayList
- Dynamic array implementation with automatic resizing
- Generic type support
- Features: doubling capacity strategy, index-based access


#### Stack & Queue
- Stack: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) implementation
- Queue: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) implementation
- Both utilize LinkedList as underlying structure


### 2. Advanced Data Structures

#### Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Self-balancing BST implementation
- AVL tree rotations for maintaining balance
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal


#### Heap
- Binary heap implementation
- Supports both min and max heap via comparator
- Used for priority queue operations


### 3. Text Processing Applications

#### Huffman Encoding
- Implementation of Huffman compression algorithm
- Uses priority queues and binary trees
- Character frequency analysis and encoding


#### Text Parser
- Word frequency analysis
- Custom LinkedList implementation for word storage
- Statistical analysis of text content


## Projects Highlights

### 1. Number Guessing Game
- Interactive console application
- Demonstrates input validation and error handling
- Binary search algorithm implementation


### 2. Word Frequency Analyzer
- Text file processing and analysis
- Data structure usage for efficient word counting
- Statistical reporting features


## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Generic Type Implementation
- Algorithm Analysis and Optimization
- Data Structure Design
- Error Handling and Input Validation
- Code Documentation and Style

## Tools and Technologies
- Language: Java
- Development Environment: Standard Java Development Kit
- Version Control: Git
- Documentation: JavaDoc

This coursework demonstrates proficiency in fundamental computer science concepts, problem-solving abilities, and practical implementation skills in Java.
